# Capstone: TrailHound

[Wes Beard](https://github.com/wesbeard), [Josh Bogin](https://github.com/JoshBogin), and I created a trail mapping app for mountain bikers.
Allows users to record routes while riding, submit trails to a public database, and browse community trails via an interactive map.

**Language**: Dart
**Framework**: Flutter
**Tools**: Google Maps API, Google Cloud, Firebase
**Design**: Google's Material 3 (Material You)
